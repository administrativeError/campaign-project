Great work, and impressive project! I definitely showed this to my friends and family over the break to brag at how amazing my class did. The overall structure of the project is great--y'all accomplished a lot with a small number of components! I feel like a lot of your `onRender` methods ended up pretty huge, and could probably have been broken into more utility methods, which I tried to accomplish in my refactors. A lot of this comes down to the complex data munging y'all had to do to transform data from the API-supplied shape into the shape the your sankey chart required, which is an impressive bit of work which could have been made more readable/scalable/maintainable by moving the munging into named functions.
